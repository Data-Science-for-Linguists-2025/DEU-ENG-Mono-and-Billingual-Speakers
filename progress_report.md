I have started the repository and set up the outline of the repository. It currently has a README, a LICENSE (that is currently undecided), and a project plan.
## Progress Report 1
#### 2/26/25 Lillian Carlson
I have loaded in the corpus and have two data frames
- one dataframe containing all the meta data (more details found in the jupyter notebook file linked below)
- one dataframe containing the raw ConLL data, a more readable format of the ConLL data, the transcription by parsing the conLL data, and  the raw audio file 

The process of developing these dataframes can be found [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2025/DEU-ENG-Mono-and-Billingual-Speakers/blob/main/LoadingRUEGData.ipynb)

This file also contains more metrics about the data such as the size, makeup, and more specific metrics about the contents (how many spoken/written data, how much formal/informal data, adolescent/adult data, and the heritage langauge distribution) 

Things to continue to accomplish: find more substantial ESL (English as a Second Language) or DSL (German as a Second Language) resources- a lot of what I have been finding has only been a handful of audio files and I want more to fully compare. I also want to organize the dataframe a little bit more in terms of sorting tokens and token, POS touples, size, ect.

Data Sharing: I plan to share all of the relevant corpus in my repo, as it is free for distribution, but I will be thoroughly scanning the license and working out the legal jargon to ensure that this is allowed.
