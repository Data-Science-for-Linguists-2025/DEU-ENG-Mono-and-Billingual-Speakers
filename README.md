## Summary
This contains an analysis on both monolingual and bilingual speakers of German and English. It compares these speakers and analyzes the relevant features that differ between these groups through the POS usage of the groups. 

## Dataset
My dataset is the RUEG corpus. Information on which can be found [here](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en/institut-en/professuren-en/rueg/rueg-corpus) and you can download it [here](https://zenodo.org/records/11234583). I used the 0.3.0 versions, however more recent versions are currently available.
